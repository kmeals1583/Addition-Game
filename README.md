# Addition-Game
Created this addition math game for my eight-year old daughter to practice her mathematics under a time limit.  
She is having issues adding under time; therefore, this was a good practicing tool for her.  
My daughter has done well since using the tool, increasing her accuracy, and decreasing time to answer.
